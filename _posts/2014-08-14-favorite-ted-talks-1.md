These are few of my favorite TED talks that I watched recently:

## Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?

A very interesting talk about the many factors contributing to the number of althletic records over the last decades.

## Never, ever give up

The story about 53 hour / 110-mile (180km) swim from Cuba to Florida

Robots that think like athletes and learn from previous experience. ([More quadcopters on TED](http://ideas.ted.com/2014/07/11/watch-these-flying-machines-are-getting-better-faster-stronger-smarter/ "Watch: These flying machines are getting better, faster, stronger"))
