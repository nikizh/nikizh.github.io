title: Hello world!
---

Welcome to my website. It’s been a long time since I bought this domain and since then I’ve tried several times to start a blog, but unfortunately I was not writing consistently. This time I intend to take time off for blogging, because I think it will be useful for me.

I’ll write mostly about software development, testing, .net, silverlight, wpf and technical stuff that’s interesting to me. However, this doesn’t mean that I’m not going to write about other interesting (and not so interesting) topics.

I think this is enough for a “Hello World!” post, so thanks for reading and keep checking for new posts and articles ツ
